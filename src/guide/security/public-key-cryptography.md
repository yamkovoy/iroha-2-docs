# Public Key Cryptography

Public key cryptography provides the means for secure communication and data protection, enabling activities such as secure online transactions, encrypted email communication, and many more `(+more examples?)`.

Public key cryptography employs a pair of cryptographic keys—a _public_ key and a _private_ key—to create a highly secure method of transmitting information over online networks.

It's easy to make a public key from a private key, but the opposite is rather difficult, if not impossible. This keeps things safe. You can freely share your public key without risking your private key, which remains secure.

## Encryption and Signatures

Public key cryptography allows individuals to send encrypted messages and data that can only be deciphered by the intended recipient possessing their corresponding private key. In other words, the public key functions as a lock, and the private key serves as an actual unique key that unlocks the encrypted data.

This encryption process not only ensures the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information but also establishes the authenticity of the sender. By combining the sender's private key with the public key, a digital _signature_ is created. This signature serves as a digital stamp of approval, verifying the sender's identity and the validity of the transferred data. Anyone with your _public_ key can verify that the person who initiated the transaction used your _private_ key.
