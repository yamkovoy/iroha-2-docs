# Generating Cryptographic Keys

In the realm of blockchain technology, cryptographic keys play a crucial role in upholding the security and authenticity of data transactions. With Iroha 2, you hold the capability to create these vital keys for safeguarding your digital assets and communications.

This section offers step-by-step instructions on how to generate cryptographic keys using `kagami`, the designated tool in-built into the Iroha 2 framework.

While this guide focuses solely on key generation by means of `kagami`, it is important to note that instructions for alternative methods might be included in the upcoming updates.

## Generating Cryptographic Keys with Kagami {#kagami}

To generate a new key pair with `kagami`, run the following:

```bash

$ cargo run --bin kagami crypto

```

You can specify a number of different parameters to tailor the generated key pair to your specific needs. The following parameters are available for customization:

  - `--algorithm` (`-a`): Specifies the algorithm used for the key pair generation and encryption. If no algorithm is specified, `ed25519` is used by default.
    Can be one of the following:

    - `ed25519` — an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithm that utilizes the Ed25519 curve, offering efficient and secure cryptographic operations for digital signatures and key exchange.

    - `secp256k1` — an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithm known for its application in blockchain systems like Bitcoin. It provides a robust foundation for secure key generation, digital signatures, and encryption.

    - `bls_small` — Boneh-Lynn-Shacham algorithm with a _small_ parameter configuration. This variant of the BLS cryptographic scheme is optimized for efficiency in certain resource-constrained environments while maintaining fundamental security properties.

    - `bls_normal` — Boneh-Lynn-Shacham algorithm with a _standard_ parameter configuration. This configuration of the BLS cryptographic scheme offers a balanced approach between efficiency and security, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in blockchain and cryptographic protocols.

  - `--seed` (`-s`): Specifies a string that serves as a starting point for the key pair generation. If no seed is specified, a random `seed` value is chosen. This parameter accepts all of the [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) characters, i.e., not only numeric and latin, but also cyrillic, logographic (e.g., Japanese kanji characters) and ideographic (e.g., emojis) characters, as well as any font-related variations of those characters introduced to Unicode over the years.

  - `--private-key` (`-p`): Specifies an existing private key that is used as to generate a _public_ key.

  - `--json` (`-j`): Specifies that the output must be generated in the JSON format.

  - `--compact` (`-c`): Specifies that the output private and public keys are displayed on separate lines and are not labeled.

You can also use the `--help` (`-h`) command to retrieve a brief summary of all the usable parameters within the CLI you are using.

### Other Operations with Kagami

#### 1. Building `kagami`

`kagami` is not deliverable as a standalone package. Therefore, it must be built first before it can be moved to a custom location (e.g., `/bin` directory for system-wide use).

To build `kagami`, run the following:

```bash

$ cargo build --bin kagami

```

#### 2. Moving `kagami` to the `/bin` directory

To move the built `kagami` executable to your system's `/bin` directory and make it globally available, run the following:

```bash

$ sudo mv kagami /bin

```

#### 3. Moving `kagami` to the `.local/bin` directory

To move `kagami` to the authenticated user's `.local/bin` directory, making it uniquely accessbible by that user, run the following:

```bash

$ mv target/debug/kagami ~/.local/bin

```

#### 4. Making the `<username>/.local/bin` directory available to the shell

If you want to use `kagami` from your user's directory, make sure that the `~/.local/bin` directory is available in your shell's `.rc` file—be it `~/.bashrc` for [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or `~/.zshrc` for the [Z shell](https://www.zsh.org/), perform the following:

To use `kagami` as a specific user, the `<username>/.local/bin` directory muse be made available in the `.rc` file of a shell—be it `~/.bashrc` for [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or `~/.zshrc` for the [Z shell](https://www.zsh.org/)—that is being used.

To make the `<username>/.local/bin` directory available to your shell's `.rc` file, perform the following:

  1. Check if `kagami` is available by running the following:

  ```bash

  $ whereis kagami
  kagami:

  ```

  2. Depending on the shell that you are using, perform one of the following:

    - **If using [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)**: Fix the `PATH` variable for the shell and then reload the `.bashrc` script by running the following:

      ```bash

      $ echo "export PATH='${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}'" >> ~/.bashrc
      $ source ~/.bashrc

      ```

    - **If using [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)**: Fix the `PATH` variable for the shell and reload the `.zshrc` script by running the following:

      ```bash

      $ echo "export PATH='${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}'" >> ~/.zshrc
      $ source ~/.zshrc

      ```

    - **If using [fish](https://fishshell.com/)**: Fix the `PATH` variable for the shell variable permanently by running the following:

      ```bash
      $ fish_add_path ~/.local/bin
      ```
